# angular-portal-builder example Application

Welcome to practice.

You will find a template using `ngSwitch` at [examples/a2b/src/app/directions](https://github.com/marvinderksen/angular-portal-builder/tree/main/projects/examples/a2b/src/app/directions). Refactor it using the `PortalBuilder` to get rid of the cluttered html.

Have a look at the main branch if you get stuck. gl hf.
